Once again you enter the Oasis which starts to feel like a second home, just this time something seems off. The usual sweet aromas of the smoke mix with something else... it smells burned. 
As soon as you passed the doorframe you recognize the chaos. Burned and destroyed furniture is everywhere, the bar counter is completely destroyed, liquid floating left and right. In the corner of the room, you spot the otter. Rearranging some of the untouched leftovers. 
"Oh, there you are my chooms. Been a while, huh? Not the best day for a visit." Despite the circumstances, Junks doesn't seem to be very affected, he seems off, his eyes aren't really focusing on you. "Told you the Loan Sharks are no good company, didn't I?" he pulls up one of the chairs with a loud thud. "Anyways, been there done that. That's what you get for being a jerk." You're not sure if Junks is talking with you or only to himself, the atmosphere seems off.
