After a long workday you take another visit the Warm Whiskers Oasis, in pure need for some fresh energy.
"Oh damn. It's my choomie shroomie! Banjam!" At the top of the counter, you recognize Junks, sitting on it, legs crossed, once again holding his pipe. The musky smell of herbs and wood seems to be even stronger than last time. "Wowkers, are you fine my choom? If I would try, I'm sure I would be able to pick up your eyebags from the floor, yup yup." Junks takes a long drag out of his pipe, spreading it into the air, while listening to your troubles.
"The Loan Sharks of the Creditorium, huh? Not the best company if you'd ask me." Junks leans into an even more comfortable pose. "Have been working with these buds since I was a youngster, mistakes were made." A short silence follows Junks statement, he doesn't seem to be keen on explaining anything further, at least not today. 
"Listen. I know a place where you can make better money out of your time. You should visit the Roots and look out for a guy called Charlie. Just mention me and you should be fine, although you might have to prove yourself first, my choom."
