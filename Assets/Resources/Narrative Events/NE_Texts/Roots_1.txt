You reach the Roots after passing through busy city streets that gradually wear thinner, transforming into winding alleys and finally ladders and stairs. Rickety shacks, bolted together catwalks and jury-rigged elevators slither down the face of the cliff like a creeper vines. Robots, outcasts and other downtrodden bustle about like worker ants, laboring, repairing and working on a thousand little things.
As you try to get your bearings you are approached by a shady figure. They wear loose fitting workers clothes, with small plants and flowers growing from their many pockets. Their face is hidden below a wide brimmed hat, yet you can make out a mechanical silhouette and the humming of electronics. The strange android notices you and walks towards you. He stops in front of you, the top of his head is decorated by small crown of green plants. "Banjam, stranger. I have been informed about your visit. I’m Charlie and this is Birb." Suddenly a little bird pops out, it was hidden inside the nest of flowers. "This place here is called "The Roots", a place where the rules of the surface don’t always reach. We are mostly robots who decide to work for ourselves, instead of working for the sharks of competition. Sometimes, other species are joining us, people who think the system of the surface doesn't fit them."
He points to a huge entrance. "If you are looking for work, I can get you started lifting crates and lugging cargo to the surface. I'll take you further down into the Roots, when you are ready."
