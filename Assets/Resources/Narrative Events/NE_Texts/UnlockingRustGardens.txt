Tseya's wrinkled face crinkles with a mix of excitement and caution as you approach her tower. "Ah, my intrepid explorer! You've cut your teeth on the Roots and braved the Cloud Sea. But now, it's time I told you about a place that will test your mettle in more ways than one - the Rust Gardens."
The old woman's eyes glimmer with an ancient light as she continues, her voice taking on a storyteller's cadence. "Imagine, if you will, a vast expanse where the line between machine and nature blurs. A desert, yes, but one unlike any you've seen before. The Rust Gardens stretch as far as the eye can see, a landscape painted in hues of ochre, copper, and iron."
She gestures with her small hands, as if sculpting the scene before you. "Forgotten ruins of a bygone era peek through dunes of metallic sand, whispering secrets of advanced civilizations long past. But it's the vegetation that will truly captivate you, my dear. Plants, if you can call them that, made not of cellulose and chlorophyll, but of alloys and oxides."
Tseya's voice lowers, a note of warning creeping in. "Copper vines climb crumbling towers, iron-bark trees sway in the static-charged winds, and fields of razor-sharp rust grass shimmer under the unforgiving sun. It's beautiful, in its own harsh way, but make no mistake - the Rust Gardens are as dangerous as they are mesmerizing."
She reaches out, patting your hand with her own. "Many adventurers have lost themselves among the magnetic mirages and corrosive storms. But for those who can navigate its perils, the Rust Gardens offer treasures beyond imagining. Ancient tech, rare metals, and secrets that could reshape our understanding of this world."
The old woman's eyes twinkle mischievously. "So, my brave Banjam, do you feel the call of the Rust Gardens? Remember, a flask of oil can be as vital as water in that mechanical wilderness. And who knows? Perhaps you'll be the one to uncover the greatest mysteries hidden beneath those rusty dunes."
Tseya settles back, her smile both encouraging and enigmatic. "When you're ready to embark on this metallic adventure, visit the Caranvanserei at the edge of the desert. Until then, rest, prepare, and dream of iron flowers under a copper sky."
