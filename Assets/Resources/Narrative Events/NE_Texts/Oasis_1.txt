After crossing a long bridge, you reach a floating isle, secluded from the busy city. The island is enveloped by fluffy clouds, drifting up from the immense sea below. A huge chunk of smoke steams out of the building it smells a bit… sweet, and with a hint of spices.
While you stare at the wonders of nature, you hear small footsteps approaching you. A small creature strolls out of the main rotunda, waddling on tiny feet, the sound is a bit funny. Still, the creature holds itself with grace, accompanied by a classy gown. In its right hand it balances a pipe, from which it inhales spicy sweet smoke.
The creature comes to a stop in front of you, stretches out it’s little hand for a greeting.
"Banjam, my choom!" You take its hand, returning his greeting. "It’s nice to see a new face around here. My name’s Junks, I’m the main otter of this house, yup yup."
He takes another deep drag from his pipe, blowing it right into your face. Your senses get clouded, now it smells woody and herbal. A little note of lemon follows. Holy smokes! This stuff seems strong.
"This place here, my little choom, is a place where you can leave behind all of your worries. Welcome to the Warm Whiskers Oasis." The otter in front of you makes a inviting gesture. "Follow me, choomba, time for you to rest, what would ya want to do first?" Junks wiggles his eyebrows towards you before he enters the building.
