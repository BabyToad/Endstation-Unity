When you enter the Oasis Junks recognizes you immediately and waddles towards you. Out of nowhere he bows in front of you, lowering his head as deep as possible. “My choomie, I have to excuse myself for last time. If it would have been my choice, I wouldn’t have wanted you to see this place or me in this kind of situation.” He seems out of breath as he looks back up to you.  
“You know, I always wanted to create a place where people can rest, take a break from their busy life, everything seems to be always about Cred.” Junks face sinks. “I was the same, everything in my life used to be about Cred but one day… I decided to change my path.” In the background people are talking and laughing, the atmosphere seems light and bubbly. “I found myself, but lost a very good friend that day; he told me dreams are for irresponsible fools.” 
“ Maybe he was right, in a way, I’m not very responsible, gotta remember to be present. But it was never a mistake to take the risk, a dream can be always be worth it, my little choom, never forget that.”
