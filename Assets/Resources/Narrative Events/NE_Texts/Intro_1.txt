You are a stranger at the end of the known universe. Whatever were before, you have left behind on your journey across the stars.
You are searching for something. Perhaps it is wealth, fame or power. Perhaps, it is knowledge, wisdom or love. Or perhaps, you will only know when you find it.

And so, you finally washed up on the far shores of the cloud sea. Endstation. That is what the wizened old stargazing woman has called it. A remote island drifting above the cloud sea, bearing only a few small houses and the stargazer's tower. They are build around the relic of an ancient void faring vessel, that has found here it's final resting place.

You have spend your last Cred to get to this place and found Tseya waiting for you, almost as if she knew you were coming. 
"Banjam, my fellow adventurer. I have been waiting for you." The old woman speaks with an almost grandmotherly familiarity. "Well, someone like you anyway."
She tilts her head to the side, her huge eyes focusing on you. "Hum, you do seem a bit lost my child. Banjam? Hah! It’s our way of saying hello, you didn’t know that?" You shake your head. She pats your knee, the only thing she is able to reach with her height. "There, there. That’s fine, all of us have to start somewhere. And I can promise you, I know exactly were." The small woman gestures towards the towards the titanic shape breaking the horizon. "You want to go to the Old Gods of the Cloud Sea. Go and come back. Than we talk more."
