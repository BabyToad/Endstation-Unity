Tseya's is waiting for you, her eyes twinkling with a knowing glint. "Ah, my dear traveler, it seems you're ready. But before you embark on this journey, there's a crucial step you must take." She motioned for you to sit beside her, her demeanor both warm and instructive.
"In this realm of exploration, every step forward often requires a bit of backing—financially, that is." Tseya's words carried a hint of amusement as she observed your puzzled expression. "Yes, yes, my dear. You'll need funds to fuel your ventures—a resource known as Creds. And where do you acquire these, you ask?"
Her gaze shifted towards the skyline, hinting at a place yet unseen. "The Guild of Creditors, a hub bustling with the business of exploration. There, amidst the labyrinthine halls and bustling crowds, you'll find the means to finance your odyssey. Seek out the master of finances. They hold the key to unlocking the resources you'll require."
Tseya's smile was reassuring, her wrinkled face like the constellation of stars. "Remember, my dear one, exploring this vast expanse often demands more than courage and curiosity—it requires a practical understanding of the currency that fuels these adventures."
With a pat on your shoulder, Tseya encouraged, "Off you go now, to the Guild of Creditors. Acquire what you need, and when you return, we shall delve deeper into the mysteries that await you on this path." Her eyes sparkled with anticipation, eagerly awaiting your return, ready to guide you through the next chapter of your exploration.
