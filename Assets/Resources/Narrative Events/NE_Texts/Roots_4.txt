You have searched for Charlie quite some time, till you find him helping out another robot repairing what looks like a one of the fusion generator powering the city infrastructure. He greets you and explains that this is something, they do quite often. “We always handle repair orders or other construction for people from the surface,” Charlie shows you the intricate circuits they are working on. “This is our way to try to stay in contact with them and show them as soon as we are treated right, we can work ten times faster and even cheaper, the higher ups hate us for this kind of business.” The robot giggles. You didn’t even know they could do that. 
“We don’t want a violent revolution; we just want to be accepted and treated like sentient beings and not like slaves for work.” Charlie pats the other robot on the head before he turns his full attention to you. “Junks has been a huge help when it comes to making new contacts for business, he is a nice guy, like you, my friend!”
They wipe their hands on their cargo pants and turn to leave. “Alrighty, off to the next project, if you help us out, I might even have a little something for you.”
