It's time for you to revisit the Loan Shark. Once again you stand in front of the massive Creditorium, the waterfall is pretty loud today, even from here you can hear the heavy splattering. You take a deep breath before you enter the building.
"Ah! There you are, I have been waiting for you. It came to my ears that you have some struggle servicing the debt." Uriah sits in front of you, gaze focused and strong. "Well, well, times are tough for all of us, you know. But have you ever considered to change your job? Maybe something with a stable income, we offer some really good positions, you know", the shark clears his throat.
"Just have a thought about it, otherwise you might end up like my old chum Junks. A sad clown who suddenly went mad with chasing dreams. And now, he is sitting on debt, clinging to a shaky business and every month is like a lottery."
Silence spreads through the room. Than Uriah goes on, his voice with a hint of regret. "You might think me callous for saying that. That I'm just a greedy shark, waiting to eat up your money but believe me, everyone got his own reasons."
