After crossing the city, you reach a massive building. It's facade towers above the surroundings like a cathedral. A lot of different species are passing by, entering, leaving and you have to take care not to get swept away by the swarm. All of them dressed in fancy suits and armed with hungry looks. It does look like the right place to fund your expedition to the Old Gods. You just hope it doesn't cost you too much.

After a while you sit in front of a scary looking shark, his shiny teeth almost blinding you. He rises one eyebrow at you, a little grumble follows. His whole aura is intimidating, the smoke of his cigar makes your eyes teary.
"Banjam. I heard you are an adventurer. Well, everyone got their own way of making money, hum." While he talks, every word is supported by a little rumbling. "I can fund the acquisition of all gear you need to get started, as well as a little extra." The shark smirks, his sharp teeth on full display. "But while I am glad to finance your adventures, I do expect a return on my investment. Every four cycles you will owe me interest. Not much only 3 Cred."
The Shark leans forward and stretches out a hand in greeting. "I am Uriah of the Guild of Creditors. Delighted to do be doing business with you."
