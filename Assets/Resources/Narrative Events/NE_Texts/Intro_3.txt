"Well, well, he isn't really keen on people like us. You know, these type of people who earn their money through adventures..."
Tseya takes a deep breath, it almost sound like a sigh. "I am getting stressed out just thinking about it. But there is someone I know who could help you out. My little... hairy friend. You'll find him not far away from here, on another floating island. His little oasis of calm is were we go to relieve our stress."
