The carcharodon creditor, holding a fat cigar, is waiting for you at his office window. “Banjam, my chum I see you can handle your payments. That’s what I want to hear! A person who can handle their money has a safe and stable future, hoho!” A cloud of smoke escapes his mouth, while he nods satisfied. This habit of his almost, reminds you of the otter back at the Warm Whiskers Oasis. Overall, you can't help but notice some similarities between those two individuals.
The shark walks back towards his fancy office chair, taking a seat. “I must admit that I’m not very... how should I say it… I’m not very keen on your way of living. You seem like a person who can handle their own. Why would you risk it all on being an adventurer? For me it’s a waste of time and don’t tell me it’s a dream of yours. That sounds foolish.” His delighted voice changed back to his rumbling, while he studies your reaction.
