Today the Endstation seems crowded. Many adventurers streaming in and out, some exhausted from their trips into the unkown, others excited for a new challenge. Your Tseya is sitting on the stoop of her tower, her little feet dangling down. She waves you towards her. "Banjam, my child. A bird has whispered me you have been spending some time with Junks. He is a nice hairy friend, isn't he? Junks has been around for a long time, not as long as me though, hoho!", the old woman chuckles. 
"I hope you were able to take a good rest at his place, it's quite comforting right? Though, I can't wait till we can gossip about the drama, hehe." You are not sure what she is hinting at.
She rocks her feet back and forth, while a group of passing adventurers greet her with a respectful bow. You wonder how someone like her is such a key figure in this place. Her gaze wanders towards you, cracking a smile. "I hope you will find out more about our little world and the connections. Here, let me heal you. Oh, and while you wait, do you want something to eat?" She proffers an antique tray, balancing a whole potters shop worth of porcelain containing hot tea and other refreshments.
