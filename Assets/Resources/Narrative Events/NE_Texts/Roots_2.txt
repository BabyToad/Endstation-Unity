On your way home from an exhausting day of work in the Roots you run into Charlie.
"Oh friend. I'm happy to see you again!" Charlie's robotic voice sounds delighted. The little bird on his head chirps. "Birb agrees! How have you been?" Both of you chat for a while, sipping on an herbal drink Charlie produced from one of his many pockets.
After you finish the bottle, the android speaks up." You are a very nice friend; your company makes my circuits go faster." Charlie's mechanic body rumbles a bit, louder than usually. "You know, I don't have many friends besides Birb. Usually, people don't like robots like me. They didn't even give me a name, only called me XX87." Silence fills the empty corridor in which you have been sitting around for a while now. "Although, you are different, you are a nice friend. Maybe next time I can show you the real part of the Roots."
