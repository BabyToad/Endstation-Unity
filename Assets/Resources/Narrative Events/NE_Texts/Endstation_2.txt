"Banjam! How have you been?" Tseya approaches you as soon as she is able to see you. You explain her what has been going on and about the people you have met. She nods her head. "I see, I see. So, you had the pleasure to met Charlie. A silly little robot, too smart for its own being. Come with me." The old lady leads you to a little table, decorated with two cups of tea. "Have a seat with me, my little adventurer."
Both of you talk for a while, she explains you the critical situation between robots and the other species. Apparently, robots were only used for a faster working process, but they adapted very quickly, and something in them sparked a greater intelligence. People started to get scared by the situation and tried to deactivate robots which have been suspicious. In her opinion, it's a very foolish move. Every living being should be given a chance, and that's what history has taught us. 
"We are such a well-developed society, it's a shame that we want to stay stubborn.", the granny sighs. "Anyway, how is your tea?"
