  _bodyText: 'Once again you find yourself inside Uriah''s office, the huge glass
    windows allowing a perfect view over the city. In the distance you can make out
    the smoke coming from the Oasis. In front of you is Uriah himself, holding something
    between his hands, staring at it, lost in his own thoughts.

    The thud of
    the door closing behind you makes him snap out of his pensive mood. "Apologies,
    I was distracted." Uriah looks hesitant, but he shows you the item, he is holding
    between his hands. It is a framed picture, showing Uriah, a woman and two children
    in front of them. Next to Uriah you recognize a well-known furry face. It is
    Junks.

    "I suppose by now, you know Junks very well; I sometimes noticed
    his sweet smell on you. We used to work in a team, you know. Together we build
    an empire. He was great and smart but he choose a different path. I''m still
    mad at him for following a selfish dream, leaving me behind." Uriah takes a deep
    breath. "But as you can see, I have a family. Something to take care of, I can''t
    just do silly decisions and joke around." The shark stands up and walks towards
    the window behind him.

    "Yet you swayed me adventurer. Perhaps sometimes
    dreaming can be worth the cost, and I won''t deny that my way has cost me also.
    Just keep in mind, everyone has their own weight to carry."'
