  _bodyText: "After crossing a long bridge, you reach a floating island, it seems
    far away, hidden from the busy city. The island is enveloped by fluffy clouds,
    which seem to be kissing the sky. Sunlight streams trough them, the atmosphere
    feels warm, like home. In front of you is a massive building, decorated by green
    plants and matured moss. A huge chunk of smoke streams out of the building it
    smells a bit\u2026 sweet. <br> While you stare at the wonders of nature, you
    hear small footsteps coming from behind you. A small creature strolls out of
    the main building, waddling on tiny feet, the sound is a bit funny. Still, the
    creature holds itself with grace, accompanied by a classy gown, in its right
    hand is a pipe. While it walks it takes the occasional drag from it. <br> The
    creature comes to a stop in front of you, stretches out it\u2019s little hand
    for a greeting. \u201CBanjam, my choom!\u201D You take its hand, returning his
    greeting. \u201CIt\u2019s nice to see a new face around here. My name\u2019s
    Junks, I\u2019m the main otter of this house, yup yup.\u201D He takes another
    deep drag from his pipe, blowing it right into your face. Your senses get clouded,
    it smells woody and herbal a little note of lemon follows. Holy smokes! This
    stuff seems strong. <br> \u201CThis place here, my little choom, is a place where
    you can leave behind all of your worries.\u201D The otter in front of you makes
    a dramatic gesture. \u201CFollow me, my fellow choom, time for you to rest, what
    would ya want to do first?\u201D Junks wiggles his eyebrows towards you before
    he enters the building."
