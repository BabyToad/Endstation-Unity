  _bodyText: "After you passed the inner city, you reach a massive building. The
    design of the building looks expensive and classy, a big contrast to your guild
    base. A lot of different species are passing by, some do enter the dome others
    do leave it. All of them dressed in fancy suits. It surely looks like the perfect
    place for paying off your credit. <br> After a while you sit in front of [insert
    description]. He rises one eyebrow at you, a little grumble follows. His whole
    aura is intimidating, the smoke of his cigarette makes your eyes teary. \u201CBanjam.
    I heard you are a little adventurer. Well, everyone got their own way of making
    money, hum.\u201D While he talks every word is supported by a little rumbling.
    \u201CI also heard you have been here for like two days and got a huge credit
    on your back?\u201D The shark smirks, his sharp teeth on full display. \u201CNice
    to do business with you.\u201D He stretches his hand out, towards you."
