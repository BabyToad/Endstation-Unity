  _bodyText: 'Despite your best efforts, the fickle nature of adventuring leaves
    you short of funds. You can feel the weight of Uriah''s gaze as he looks at you,
    his shark-like eyes piercing through the room. The usual cloud of cigar smoke
    hangs heavily, adding to the sense of foreboding.

    "Before you leave, my
    adventurer," Uriah says, his tone more serious than before. "I''ve noticed your
    financial struggles. You''re not keeping up with the payments, and that''s not
    good for business, you know."

    His sharp teeth are more pronounced as he
    continues, "You have two options now. First, you can do me favor. It is risky
    and dangerous job in the Roots. If you manage it, I''ll even pay you a bonus.

    Or,
    you can work for the Guild directly. We have lots of archival work this cycle
    and there are never enough clerks.'
