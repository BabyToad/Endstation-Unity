  _bodyText: 'A clandestine entrance, elusive and camouflaged, defies the discerning
    eye - a convergence of vaporous veils and atmospheric vagaries conspiring to
    conceal its existence from all but the most astute wanderer. Within this amorphous
    canvas, an interplay of meteorological phenomena serves as a riddle, a choreography
    of swirling mists and capricious currents that obscure the path to the giants''
    entrance.

    There you find a passage not of mere stone and mortar, but of
    cloud currents and enigmatic vibrations, beckoning those intrepid enough to decipher
    the symphony of the unseen and traverse the liminal boundary into the enshrouded
    realm of the Old Gods.'
