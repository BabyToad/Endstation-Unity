  _bodyText: 'On your way home from an exhausting day of work in the Roots you run
    into Charlie.

    "Oh friend. I''m happy to see you again!" Charlie''s robotic
    voice sounds delighted. The little bird on his head chirps. "Birb agrees! How
    have you been?" Both of you chat for a while, sipping on an herbal drink Charlie
    produced from one of his many pockets.

    After you finish the bottle, the
    android speaks up." You are a very nice friend; your company makes my circuits
    go faster." Charlie''s mechanic body rumbles a bit, louder than usually. "You
    know, I don''t have many friends besides Birb. Usually, people don''t like robots
    like me. They didn''t even give me a name, only called me XX87." Silence fills
    the empty corridor in which you have been sitting around for a while now. "Although,
    you are different, you are a nice friend. Maybe next time I can show you the
    real part of the Roots."'
