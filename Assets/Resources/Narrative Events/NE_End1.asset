  _bodyText: "Today the Endstation seems crowded. Many adventurers streaming in and
    out, some exhausted from their trips into the unkown, others excited for a new
    challenge. Your Tseya is sitting on the stoop of her tower, her little feet dangling
    down. She waves you towards her. \"Banjam, my child. A bird has whispered me
    you have been spending some time with Junks. He is a nice hairy friend, isn't
    he? Junks has been around for a long time, not as long as me though, hoho!\",
    the old woman chuckles. \r\n\"I hope you were able to take a good rest at his
    place, it's quite comforting right? Though, I can't wait till we can gossip about
    the drama, hehe.\" You are not sure what she is hinting at.\r\nShe rocks her
    feet back and forth, while a group of passing adventurers greet her with a respectful
    bow. You wonder how someone like her is such a key figure in this place. Her
    gaze wanders towards you, cracking a smile. \"I hope you will find out more about
    our little world and the connections. Here, let me heal you. Oh, and while you
    wait, do you want something to eat?\" She proffers an antique tray, balancing
    a whole potters shop worth of porcelain containing hot tea and other refreshments."
