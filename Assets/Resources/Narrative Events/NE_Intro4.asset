  _bodyText: 'Tseya''s aged eyes gleam with a newfound excitement as she welcomes
    you back from the Oasis. "Ah, my intrepid adventurer, you look ready for adventure
    again. Now, let me share with you another facet of our world - the Roots."

    Her
    voice lowers, filled with a hint of mystery as she leans closer. "Beneath the
    bustling cityscape and the floating islands lies a network of passages, chambers,
    and alcoves known as the Roots. It''s a place where the outcasts, the misfits,
    and the mechanical marvels coexist in a symphony of life and ingenuity."

    Tseya
    gestures dramatically, as if revealing a hidden secret. "The Roots are not just
    the underbelly; they''re the beating heart of our society. Home to the ingenious
    inventors, rogue mechanics, and those who defy the norms. It''s a place where
    you, my dear adventurer, can find opportunities to earn the precious Creds you
    seek."

    Her eyes twinkle with a mix of mischief and encouragement. "Venture
    into the depths when you''re ready, and you''ll discover tasks and challenges
    waiting for a capable soul like yourself. Work hard, prove your mettle, and the
    Roots will reward you generously. Remember, the undercurrents beneath the city
    hold more than secrets = they hold the currency of opportunity."

    Tseya
    pats your back with a knowing smile. "Now, off you go. Return to me when you
    need to recover some of your vigor, for I am known to have a healing touch. As
    well as excellent biscuits and tea. You won''t regret it."'
