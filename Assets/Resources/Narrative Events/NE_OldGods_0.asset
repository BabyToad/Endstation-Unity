  _bodyText: 'Nestled within the ethereal expanse of the celestial sea, the Old Gods
    emerge like primeval guardians, their titanic presence shrouded in the mists
    of time.

    As you draw nearer, an abyssal chasm unfurls amidst the monumental
    stone countenances, their vacuous ocular apertures extending a tacit invitation
    into an past lost to collective memory.

    Not once have you found something
    so...  There are no words for it. Your feelings are more than can be expressed
    in common language. This place is unlike anything you have experienced.

    Whatever
    it is you were searching for, you will find it here. But for now you do not find
    a way to enter.'
