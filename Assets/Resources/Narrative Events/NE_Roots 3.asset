  _bodyText: "The next time you meet Charlie, he takes you lower than you have ever
    been before. The place you have been working at was only the tip of the iceberg.
    Below the Roots are filled with a patchwork buildings and habitats. Around every
    corner you recognize another kind of robot, working on different things. A duo
    of small furry creatures tinkers with the main actuator of a cargo-bot, while
    a third sells motor oil. He shows you around and explains everything. \"This
    my friend, is our hidden sanctuary, our little paradise.\" \r\n\"You know that
    us robots... we are usually used for the hard work outside which other species
    don't want to do. But as soon as we got to good at it, they got afraid of us.
    Prohibitions on artificial intellects and throttling of cogitators if you complained.\"
    His robotic voice seems a bit sad given the situation. \"I was one of them, but
    I didn't want this kind of destiny. Not for me or any other robot. Or person
    for that matter. So, I created this place, a retreat for everyone who doesn't
    support this kind of system. Together we want to change something.\" On his head
    Birb flatters around, chirping happily. \"I hope you would like to join us, changing
    the world to something better.\""
