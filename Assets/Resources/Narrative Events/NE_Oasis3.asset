  _bodyText: "Once again you enter the Oasis which starts to feel like a second home,
    just this time something seems off. The usual sweet aromas of the smoke mix with
    something else... it smells burned. \r\nAs soon as you passed the doorframe you
    recognize the chaos. Burned and destroyed furniture is everywhere, the bar counter
    is completely destroyed, liquid floating left and right. In the corner of the
    room, you spot the otter. Rearranging some of the untouched leftovers. \r\n\"Oh,
    there you are my chooms. Been a while, huh? Not the best day for a visit.\" Despite
    the circumstances, Junks doesn't seem to be very affected, he seems off, his
    eyes aren't really focusing on you. \"Told you the Loan Sharks are no good company,
    didn't I?\" he pulls up one of the chairs with a loud thud. \"Anyways, been there
    done that. That's what you get for being a jerk.\" You're not sure if Junks is
    talking with you or only to himself, the atmosphere seems off. "
