  _bodyText: "After crossing a long bridge, you reach a floating isle, secluded from
    the busy city. The island is enveloped by fluffy clouds, drifting up from the
    immense sea below. A huge chunk of smoke steams out of the building it smells
    a bit\uFFFD sweet, and with a hint of spices.\nWhile you stare at the wonders
    of nature, you hear small footsteps approaching you. A small creature strolls
    out of the main rotunda, waddling on tiny feet, the sound is a bit funny. Still,
    the creature holds itself with grace, accompanied by a classy gown. In its right
    hand it balances a pipe, from which it inhales spicy sweet smoke.\nThe creature
    comes to a stop in front of you, stretches out it\uFFFDs little hand for a greeting.\n\uFFFDBanjam,
    my choom!\uFFFD You take its hand, returning his greeting. \uFFFDIt\uFFFDs nice
    to see a new face around here. My name\uFFFDs Junks, I\uFFFDm the main otter
    of this house, yup yup.\uFFFD\nHe takes another deep drag from his pipe, blowing
    it right into your face. Your senses get clouded, now it smells woody and herbal.
    A little note of lemon follows. Holy smokes! This stuff seems strong.\n\uFFFDThis
    place here, my little choom, is a place where you can leave behind all of your
    worries. Welcome to the Warm Whiskers Oasis.\uFFFD The otter in front of you
    makes a inviting gesture. \uFFFDFollow me, choomba, time for you to rest, what
    would ya want to do first?\uFFFD Junks wiggles his eyebrows towards you before
    he enters the building."
