  _bodyText: "You are a stranger at the end of the known universe. Whatever you were
    before, you have left behind on your journey across the stars.\r\nYou are searching
    for something. Perhaps, it is wealth, fame or power. Perhaps, it is knowledge,
    wisdom or love. Or perhaps, you will only know when you find it.\r\n\r\nAnd so,
    you finally washed up on the far shores of the cloud sea. Endstation. That is
    what the wizened old stargazing woman has called it. A remote island drifting
    above the cloud sea, bearing only a few small houses and the stargazer's tower.
    They are build around the relic of an ancient void faring vessel, that has found
    its final resting place here.\r\n\r\nYou have spent your last Cred to get to
    this place and found Tseya waiting for you, almost as if she knew you were coming.
    \r\n\"Banjam, my fellow adventurer. I have been waiting for you.\" The old woman
    speaks with an almost grandmotherly familiarity. \"Well, someone like you anyway.\"\r\nShe
    tilts her head to one side, her huge eyes focusing on you. \"Hum, you do seem
    a bit lost, child. Banjam? Hah! It's our way of saying hello, you didn't know
    that?\" You shake your head. She pats your knee, the only thing she is able to
    reach with her height. \"There, there. That's fine, all of us have to start somewhere.
    And I can promise you, I know exactly where.\" The small woman gestures towards
    the titanic shape breaking up the horizon. \"You want to go to the Old Gods of
    the Cloud Sea. Go, and come back. Then we talk more.\""
