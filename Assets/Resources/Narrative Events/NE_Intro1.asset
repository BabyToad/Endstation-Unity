  _bodyText: "You are a stranger at the end of the known universe. Whatever were
    before, you have left behind on your journey across the stars.\nYou are searching
    for something. Perhaps it is wealth, fame or power. Perhaps, it is knowledge,
    wisdom or love. Or perhaps, you will only know when you find it.\n\nAnd so, you
    finally washed up on the far shores of the cloud sea. Endstation. That is what
    the wizened old stargazing woman has called it. A remote island drifting above
    the cloud sea, bearing only a few small houses and the stargazer's tower. They
    are build around the relic of an ancient void faring vessel, that has found here
    it's final resting place.\n\nYou have spend your last Cred to get to this place
    and found Tseya waiting for you, almost as if she knew you were coming. \n\"Banjam,
    my fellow adventurer. I have been waiting for you.\" The old woman speaks with
    an almost grandmotherly familiarity. \"Well, someone like you anyway.\"\nShe
    tilts her head to the side, her huge eyes focusing on you. \"Hum, you do seem
    a bit lost my child. Banjam? Hah! It\uFFFDs our way of saying hello, you didn\uFFFDt
    know that?\" You shake your head. She pats your knee, the only thing she is able
    to reach with her height. \"There, there. That\uFFFDs fine, all of us have to
    start somewhere. And I can promise you, I know exactly were.\" The small woman
    gestures towards the towards the titanic shape breaking the horizon. \"You want
    to go to the Old Gods of the Cloud Sea. Go and come back. Than we talk more.\""
