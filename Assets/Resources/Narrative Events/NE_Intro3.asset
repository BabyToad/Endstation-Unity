  _bodyText: '"Anyways, you have returned from the Creditorium. How was meeting that
    ruthless loan shark, Uriah. Must have been an experience, huh." The small woman

    just thinking about it. But there is someone I know who could help you out. My

    island. His little oasis of calm is were we go to relieve our stress."'
