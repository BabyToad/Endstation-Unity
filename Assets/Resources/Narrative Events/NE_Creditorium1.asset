  _bodyText: 'After crossing the city, you reach a massive building. It''s facade
    towers above the surroundings like a cathedral. A lot of different species are
    passing by, entering, leaving and you have to take care not to get swept away
    by the swarm. All of them dressed in fancy suits and armed with hungry looks.
    It does look like the right place to fund your expedition to the Old Gods. You
    just hope it doesn''t cost you too much.

    

    After a while you sit in
    front of a scary looking shark, his shiny teeth almost blinding you. He rises
    one eyebrow at you, a little grumble follows. His whole aura is intimidating,
    the smoke of his cigar makes your eyes teary.

    "Banjam. I heard you are
    an adventurer. Well, everyone got their own way of making money, hum." While
    he talks, every word is supported by a little rumbling. "I can fund the acquisition
    of all gear you need to get started, as well as a little extra." The shark smirks,
    his sharp teeth on full display. "But while I am glad to finance your adventures,
    I do expect a return on my investment. Every four cycles you will owe me interest.
    Not much only 3 Cred."

    The Shark leans forward and stretches out a hand
    in greeting. "I am Uriah of the Guild of Creditors. Delighted to do be doing
    business with you."'
