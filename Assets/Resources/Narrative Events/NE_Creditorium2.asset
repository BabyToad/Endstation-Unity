  _bodyText: 'The carcharodon creditor, holding a fat cigar, is waiting for you at
    his office window. "Banjam, my chum I see you can handle your payments. That''s
    what I want to hear! A person who can handle their money has a safe and stable
    future, hoho!" A cloud of smoke escapes his mouth, while he nods satisfied. This
    habit of his almost, reminds you of the otter back at the Warm Whiskers Oasis.
    Overall, you can''t help but notice some similarities between those two individuals.

    The
    shark walks back towards his fancy office chair, taking a seat. "I must admit
    that I''m not very... how should I say it... I''m not very keen on your way of
    living. You seem like a person who can handle their own. Why would you risk it
    all on being an adventurer? It is a waste of time and don''t tell me it''s a
    dream of yours. That sounds foolish." His delighted voice changed back to his
    rumbling, while he studies your reaction. '
