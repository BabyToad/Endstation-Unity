  _bodyText: "\"Banjam, my chum I see servicing your debt is going well. That's what
    I want to hear! A person who can handle their money has a safe and stable future,
    hoho!\" A cloud of smoke escapes his mouth, while he nods satisfied. This habit
    of his almost, reminds you of the otter back at the Warm Whiskers Oasis. Overall,
    you can't help but notice some similarities between those two individuals.\r\nThe
    shark walks back towards his fancy office chair, taking a seat. \"I must admit
    that I'm not very\uFFFD how should I say it\uFFFD I'm not very keen on your way
    of living. You seem like a person who can handle their own. Why would you choose
    to be an adventurer, if there are better ways to support yourself? For me it's
    a waste of time and don't tell me it's a dream of yours. That sounds foolish.\"
    His delighted voice changed back to his rumbling, while he studies your reaction. "
