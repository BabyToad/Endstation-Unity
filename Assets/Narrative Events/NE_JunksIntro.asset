  _bodyText: "A small creature strolls out of the main building, it waddles on tiny
    feets, the sound is a bit funny. Still, the creature holds itself with grace,
    accompanied by a classy kimono, in its right hand is a pipe. While it walks it
    takes occasionally a little drag out of it. The creature comes to a stop in front
    of you, stretches out it\u2019s little hand for a greeting. \u201CBanjam, my
    choom!\u201D You take it\u2019s hand, returning his greeting. \u201CIt\u2019s
    nice to see a new face in here. My name\u2019s Junks, I\u2019m the main otter
    of this house, yup yup.\u201D He takes another deep drag out of his pipe, blowing
    it right into your face. Your senses get clouded, it smells woody and herbal
    a little note of lemon follows. Holy shit, this stuff seems strong. \u201CThis
    place here, my little choom, is a place where you can leave behind all of your
    worries.\u201D The otter in front of you makes a dramatic gesture. \u201CYou
    seem to be very stressed. I can see the eyebags under ya eyes and your energy
    seems very, ya know, sucked dry.\u201D Junks wiggles his eyebrows towards you."
